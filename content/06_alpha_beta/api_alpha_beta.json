Scientific Background</h2>\n<p>In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets\nprovided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior\nstudies that led to the creation of the data you will aim to simulate.\nThis tutorial is based on results from Jones et al.\u00a02009 where, using\nMEG, we recorded spontaneous (pre-stimulus) alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta\n(15-20 Hz) rhythms that arise as part of the mu-complex from the primary\nsomatosensory cortex (S1) <a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\"\nid=\"fnref1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a>.

On any individual trial (i.e., 1\nsecond of spontaneous data), the presence of alpha and beta activity is\nnot time locked and representative of so-called \u201cinduced\u201d activity.\nSeemingly continuous bands of activity occur only when averaging the\nspectrograms across trials (Figure 2 top panel, left), and this is due\nto the fact that the spectrograms values are strictly positive and the"

This drive\nconsisted of two nearly-synchronous 10 Hz rhythmic drives that contacted\nthe network through proximal and distal projection pathways (Figure 3).\nThe drives were simulated as population \u201cbursts\u201d of action potentials\nthat contacted the network every 100ms with the mean delay between the\nproximal and distal burst of 0ms. Specifically, as shown schematically\nin Figure 3, the population bursts consisted of 10, 2-spike bursts\nGaussian distributed in time. We presumed that during such spontaneous\nactivity, these drives may be provided by leminscial and non-lemniscal\nthalamic nuclei, which contact proximal and distal pyramidal neurons\nrespectively, and they are know to burst fire at ~10 Hz frequencies in"

As such, the effective strengths of the exogenous driving\ninputs were tuned so that the cells in the network remained subthreshold\n(all other parameters were tuned and fixed base on the morphology,\nphysiology and connectivity within layered neocortical circuits, see\nJones et al.\u00a02009 [1] for details). The inputs drove subthreshold\ncurrents up and down the pyramidal neurons to reproduce accurate\nwaveform and spectrogram features (see Figure 3). A scaling factor of\n3000 was multiplied by the model waveform to reproduce nAm units\ncomparable to the recorded data, suggesting on the order 200 x 3000 =\n600,000 pyramidal neurons contributed to this signal.</p>\n<p>We further found that decreasing the delay between the drives to\n~50ms created a pure alpha oscillation, while applying an ~0ms delay\ncaused beta events to emerge and increased the strength of the distal\ndrive, creating stronger beta activity (data not shown; see parameter\nexploration below). This result led to the novel prediction that brief\nbeta events emerge from a broad proximal drive disrupted by a\nsimultaneous strong distal drive that lasted 50ms (i.e., one beta\nperiod). Support for this prediction was found invasively with laminar\nrecordings in mice and monkeys [3].</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will explore parameter changes that illustrate\nthese results. We will walk you step-by-step through simulations with\nvarious combinations of rhythmic proximal and distal drives to describe\nhow each contributes to the alpha and beta components of the SI\nalpha/beta complex rhythm. We will begin by simulating only rhythmic\nproximal alpha frequency inputs (Step 1), followed by simulating only\ndistal alpha frequency inputs (Step 2), followed by various combinations\nof proximal and distal drive to generate alpha and beta rhythms.

Due to the stochastic nature of the inputs, there is some\nvariability in the timing and duration of the input bursts such that\nsometimes they arrive at the same time and sometimes there is a slight\noffset between them. As a result, intermittent transient alpha and beta\nevents emerge in the time-frequency spectrogram. Alpha events are\nproduced when the inputs occur slightly out of phase and current flow is\npushed alternately up and down the dendrites for ~50 ms duration each\n(set by the length of the bursts inputs). Beta events occur when the\nburst inputs arrive more synchronously and the upward current flow is\ndisrupted by downward current flow for ~50 ms to effectively cut the\noscillation period in half. As such, the relative alpha to beta\nexpression can be controlled by the delay between the inputs and their\nrelative burst strengths. We will detail this further below (see step 6\nbelow).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the results from only proximal or distal input, since\nthe current in the pyramidal neurons is pushed both upward and downward\nin this simulation, the current dipole signal oscillates above and below\n0 nAm, which qualitatively matches the experimental data (see Figures 1\nand 2 in \u201cGetting Started\u201d). Additionally, this simulation reproduces\nthe transient nature of the alpha and beta activity and several other\nfeatures of the waveform and spectrogram can be quantified to show close\nagreement between model and experimental results (see Figure 2 above,\nand Jones et al.\u00a02009[1], for further details).</p>\n<p>We note that here we do not directly compare the spontaneous current\ndipole waveform to recorded data, as was done in the ERP tutorial with a\nroot mean squared error. This is due to the fact that the spontaneous SI\nsignal we are simulating is not time locked to alpha or beta events on\nany given trial, and the stochastic nature of the driving inputs causes\nvariability in the timing of the alpha or beta activity, making it\ndifficult to align recorded data and simulated results. However, a\ndirect comparison can be made between time averaged recorded and\nsimulated signals by comparing power spectral density waveforms. An\nexample of comparison is shown in step 5 below.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class='markdown-cell'>\n    <h3>3.3 Simulating and averaging multiple trials with jittered start\ntimes creates the impression of continuous oscillations</h3>\n<p>As described in the \u201cGetting Started\u201d section above, our simulation\ngoal was to study the mechanisms that reproduce features of spontaneous\nalpha and beta rhythms observed in un-averaged data, where the alpha and\nbeta components are transient and intermittent (Figure 1, right panel).\nEach tutorial step up to this point was based on simulating un-averaged\ndata. Here, we describe how to run and average multiple \u201ctrials\u201d (700 ms\nepochs of spontaneous activity). We show that, due to the stochastic\nnature of the proximal and distal rhythmic input, controlled by the\nstandard deviation of the start times <code>tstart_std</code>, and the\nstdev of the input bursts <code>burst_std</code>, when running multiple\ntrials, the precise timing of the input bursts on each trial is\njittered, and hence the alpha and beta activity in the spectrograms on\neach trial is jittered. This is akin to simulating induced rhythms\nrather than time-locked evoked rhythms. In the averaged spectrogram\nacross trials, the alpha and beta events accumulate without cancellation\n(due to the fact that spectrogram value are purely positive) creating\nthe impression of a continuous oscillation (Figure 1, left panel).</p>\n<p>Below we illustrate the effects of \u201cjitter\u201d in the proximal and\ndistal rhythmic inputs across trials in two ways. First, we examine the\neffects of \u201cjitter\u201d due to the <code>burst_std</code>, and second due to\nthe <code>tstart_std</code>.</p>\n<p>To first test the effects of jittering due to <code>burst_std</code>\nand averaging across trials, we will use a drive configuration with\nrhythmic proximal and distal inputs provided at 10 Hz, with proximal and\ndistal inputs in phase. These are the same parameters as Step 3.2 above,\nbut now with 5 trials instead of 1.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class='code-cell'>\n    <code class='language-python'>\n        net_alpha_trials = jones_2009_model()\n\nnet_alpha_trials.add_bursty_drive(\n    'alpha_prox', tstart=50.0, tstart_std=0.0, burst_rate=10, burst_std=20, numspikes=2,\n    spike_isi=10, n_drive_cells=10, location='proximal',\n    weights_ampa=weights_ampa_p, synaptic_delays=syn_delays_p, event_seed=10)\n\nnet_alpha_trials.add_bursty_drive(\n    'alpha_dist', tstart=50.0, tstart_std=0.0, burst_rate=10, burst_std=20, numspikes=2,\n    spike_isi=10, n_drive_cells=10, location='distal',\n    weights_ampa=weights_ampa_d, synaptic_delays=syn_delays_d, event_seed=15)\n    \nwith MPIBackend(n_procs=n_procs):\n    dpl_alpha_trials = simulate_dipole(net_alpha_trials, tstop=710.0, n_trials=5)\n\n# dpl_alpha_trials = simulate_dipole(net_alpha_trials, tstop=710.0, n_trials=5)\n    </code>\n</div>\n<div class='output-cell error'>\n    <pre>\n        \u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell \u001b[0;32mIn[1], line 1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0m net_alpha_trials \u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m \u001b[43mjones_2009_model\u001b[49m()\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m net_alpha_trials\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39madd_bursty_drive(\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m     \u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124malpha_prox\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m, tstart\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m50.0\u001b[39m, tstart_std\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m0.0\u001b[39m, burst_rate\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, burst_std\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m20\u001b[39m, numspikes\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m2\u001b[39m,\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m     spike_isi\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, n_drive_cells\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, location\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mproximal\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m,\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m     weights_ampa\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39mweights_ampa_p, synaptic_delays\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39msyn_delays_p, event_seed\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m)\n\u001b[1;32m      8\u001b[0m net_alpha_trials\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39madd_bursty_drive(\n\u001b[1;32m      9\u001b[0m     \u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124malpha_dist\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m, tstart\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m50.0\u001b[39m, tstart_std\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m0.0\u001b[39m, burst_rate\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, burst_std\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m20\u001b[39m, numspikes\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m2\u001b[39m,\n\u001b[1;32m     10\u001b[0m     spike_isi\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, n_drive_cells\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m10\u001b[39m, location\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124mdistal\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m,\n\u001b[1;32m     11\u001b[0m     weights_ampa\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39mweights_ampa_d, synaptic_delays\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39msyn_delays_d, event_seed\u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;241m15\u001b[39m)\n\n\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'jones_2009_model' is not defined\n    </pre>\n</div>\n<div class='code-cell'>\n    <code class='language-python'>\n        # Note that a spike is induced on certain trials\n# We have excluded trials with spikes since the high-amplitude dipole dominates the average spectrogram\nnospike_trials = [0,1,2,3]\ndpl_alpha_nospike = [dpl_alpha_trials[idx] for idx in nospike_trials]\nsimulation_plots(net_alpha_trials, dpl_alpha_nospike)\n    </code>\n</div>\n<div class='markdown-cell'>\n    <p>Notice that the input histograms for distal (green) and proximal\n(red) input accumulated across the 5 trials, now have higher values than\nbefore (up to ~20 compared to 5 in Step 3.2) and the burst inputs are\nslightly broader on each cycle, since these histograms represent the\naccumulated activity from 10 simulations, where the standard deviation\nin the Burst duration across trials is 20 ms.

Since the proximal\ninput Start time mean is 50.0 ms and the the distal input Start time\nmean is 100.0 ms, the input will, on average, arrive to the network a\n1/2 cycle out of phase (i.e., in antiphase, every 50 ms).</p>\n<p>Next, we will run the simulation to investigate the impact of this\nparameter change.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class='code-cell'>\n    <code class='language-python'>\n        # Your code here\n    </code>\n</div>\n<div class='markdown-cell'>\n    <p>Notice that the histogram profile of the proximal and distal input\nbursts are generally \u00bd cycle out-of-phase (antiphase). This rhythmic\nalteration of proximal followed by distal drive induces alternating\nsubthreshold current flow up and down the pyramidal neuron dendrites to\ncreate a continuous alpha oscillation in the current dipole waveform\nthat oscillates around 0 nAm. The period of the oscillation is set by\nthe duration of each burst (~50 ms, controlled in part by Burst stdev)\nand the 50 ms delay between the inputs on each cycle (due to different\nstart times). The corresponding spectrogram shows continuous nearly pure\nalpha activity. This type of strong alpha activity is similar to what\nmight be observed over occipital cortex during eyes closed"
